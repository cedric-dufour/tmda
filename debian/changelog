tmda (1.3.20171127a) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NEW RELEASE: TMDA 1.3.x "Ph3nix (Python 3 reborn)"

  - TMDA now relies on Python 3
    LDAP support is now based on PyLDAP
      (https://github.com/pyldap/pyldap).
    PAM support is now based on python-pam
      (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-pam)

  - Message content handling now relies entirely on (undecoded) bytes
    strings and binary files. This hopefully will solve all charset
    (Content-Type) and encoding (Content-Transfer-Encoding) issues.

  - Bounce templates MUST now use a single charset, globally set (for
    the entire template) with the 'X-TMDA-Template-Charset' header.
    See the UPGRADE files for further details.

  - SECURITY: user-originated scripts (or arguments) are no longer
    executed through the system shell to prevent potential commands
    injection. Consequently, such scripts may NO LONGER be specified
    with arguments (other than those passed by TMDA itself).

  - NEW: tmda-ofmipd now allows to specifiy Diffie-Hellman parameters
    file with the '--ssl-dh' option (which allows to use all DH-based
    ciphers and achieve forward secrecy). It also possible to disable
    SSLv2 and SSLv3 protocols altogether, thanks to the '--ssl-no-v2'
    and '--ssl-no-v3' options.

  - NEW: BATV (Bounce Address Tag Validation) and SRS (Sender Rewriting
    Scheme) sender (envelope) addresses are now properly unmangled.

  - NEW: user can now specify the HMAC algorithm, including its PBKDF2
    derivative. The default algorithm and bytes size have been bumped
    to PBKDF2+SHA256, 5 bytes, 100'000 rounds.
    See the UPGRADE files for further details.

  - NEW: key rollover (*_ROLLOVER settings) now allow one to change
    the key/algo/size without breaking existing tags/addresses (the
    time it takes to replace them)

  - NEW: Tag encoding is now alphanumeric instead of hexadecimal,
    allowing to save 30% on their length.
    See the UPGRADE files for further details.
